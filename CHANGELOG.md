- When you select a song in freeplay it plays that song's instrumental again and with no lag! (This was disabled in a prior update due to some issues with the new libraries).
### Fixed
- GF's animations have been fixed (she would go up like 20 pixels when the player broke a combo before).
- Freeplay songs are now unlocked just like weeks.
### Known Issues
- I do know that GF's layering on the limo stage is broken, but I have not found a solution to fixing this yet without just seperating the limo from it's stage.
