- Millisecond timer when hitting notes.
- You can now access previously unaccessible Debug Songs with the Debug Songs option in the options menu.
- A new rating system.

- Song name and difficulty to the bottom of the screen while playing.

### Changed
- Organized classes into packages.
- Health icons can now have more general types (like bf and senpai), instead of having to write down the same icon mutliple times in code.
- Alphabet now has more stuff (like bold numbers), which I took from the Agoti mod (yes ik I didn't make it myself, but I don't have adobe animate so ¯＼_(ツ)_/¯)
- Optimized the title screen by not loading unneccesary libraries on launch.
### Fixed
- Song names like Philly and Dadbattle have been replaced to their actual song names (Philly Nice and Dad Battle).
- The layering of GF on the limo stage has now been fixed! (:pog:)
### Re-Added
- When pressing 9 in-game it now will revert your health icon to bf-old (because idk why I removed it).

- When you select a song in freeplay it plays that song's instrumental again and with no lag! (This was disabled in a prior update due to some issues with the new libraries).
### Fixed
- GF's animations have been fixed (she would go up like 20 pixels when the player broke a combo before).
- Freeplay songs are now unlocked just like weeks.
### Known Issues
- I do know that GF's layering on the limo stage is broken, but I have not found a solution to fixing this yet without just seperating the limo from it's stage.
