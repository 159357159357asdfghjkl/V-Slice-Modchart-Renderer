# Modding Guide Thingy for Leather Engine 0.3

## Setup

The first thing you'll need to do is open up the mods folder in the executeable directory. Then after that, make a new folder with the name of your mod.

Inside this folder, you'll need two things for the game to recognize your mod as a mod. A PNG image named _polymod_icon and a JSON text file named _polymod_meta, you can find examples for these in the Template Mod that should also be in the mods folder.

Once you have those two files in, you should probably edit them to match your mod (little tip here, the title of your mod is determined by the `title` variable in *_polymod_meta.json* that's in your mod folder).

Once all that is done, it's time to add other things to your mod!
