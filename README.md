# FORK CHANGES

This fork changes many things that I hope to eventually pull request into the original repo or whatever.

1) Songs are loaded from the "songs/" folder rather than being hard coded
2) Songs are self contained within a folder
3) The weeks list is now editable and loaded from a json (still WIP because hard coding shit)
4) Remove shitty code and fix bugs
5) more to come
