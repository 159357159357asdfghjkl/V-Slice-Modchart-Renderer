## Build Instructions

For build intructions go to [Build.md](https://github.com/Leather128/LeathersFunkinEngine/blob/master/Build.md)

## Features

> Proper Options Menu

This includes things like custom controls, downscroll, opponent note glow, etc.

> Week Progression

You can now properly progress through weeks if you wish, aka you don't unlock everything at the start.

> Extras

For fun I added some things like the old title screen, and debug songs in freeplay as options in the options menu.
