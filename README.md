# Zyflixel Engine

A FNF Engine Built Off Of Base Game

TODO:
- Add script support in the form of hscript using [SScript](https://github.com/BeastlyGabi/SScript/) (Almost Done | Update: 
SScript may be switched out for [HScript Improved](https://github.com/FNF-CNE-Devs/hscript-improved) due to it being more reliable)

- Softcode characters (with hscript)
- Remake the options menu

This todo list is still WIP. More will be added as time goes on.
