# Leather's Funkin' Engine

This is the repository for Leather's Funkin' Engine, an engine created for making mods for Friday Night Funkin'.

## Build Instructions

For build intructions go to [Build.md](https://github.com/Leather128/LeathersFunkinEngine/blob/master/Build.md)

## Features

> Proper Options Menu

This includes things like custom controls, downscroll, opponent note glow, etc.

> Extras

For fun I added some things like the old title screen, and debug songs in freeplay as options in the options menu.

> Full mod support

Support for custom songs, characters, stages, weeks, basic cutscenes (videos and dialogue), all without modifying the source code (just some files in the assets folder).

> Character creator

You can create characters easily with the character creator (you can even drag and drop on images for the spritesheets!).

> More to come...
