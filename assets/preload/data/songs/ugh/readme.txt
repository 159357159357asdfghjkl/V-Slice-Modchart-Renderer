HEY! if your going to change the timings that Tankman goes 'Ugh!' with the steps.txt then just remember this.

The game checks if the CurStep (labeled as such in the song charter) is one of those lines, if it is it plays tankman's ugh animation.

So to add new 'Ugh!'s just go into the song charter, load up UGH, and find what curstep it is on each 'ugh' (or other sound effect idk)

Then just add that as a new line to steps.txt and your good!

To any modders making remixes or something of this song, your welcome!
