# Assets & Unhardcoding
One of the main focuses for UFNF is the unhardcoding of certain aspects of the game to allow for easier modding.<br>
However if you want to add new assets you still need to compile from source because of asset cache! If you don't UFNF won't be able to find your asset. (this may be fixed with polymod idk)

## Unharcode locations
Week Data : ``assets/preload/data/weekshit.json`` <br>
Freeplay Songs : ``assets/preload/data/freeplaySonglist.txt`` <br>
Characters : ``assets/preload/data/characters.json`` <br>
Health Icons : ``assets/preload/data/healthicons.txt`` <br>
Health Colors : ``assets/preload/data/healthcolors.txt`` <br>
