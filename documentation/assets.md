# Assets & Unhardcoding
One of the main focuses for UFNF is the unhardcoding of certain aspects of the game to allow for easier modding.<br>
However if you want to add new assets you still need to compile from source because of asset cache! If you don't UFNF won't be able to find your asset.

## Unharcode locations
Week Data : ``assets/preload/data/weekshit.json``
Freeplay Songs : ``assets/preload/data/freeplaySonglist.txt``
Characters : ``assets/preload/data/characters.json``
Health Icons : ``assets/preload/data/healthicons.txt``
Health Colors : ``assets/preload/data/healthcolors.txt``
